	 Assignment component interface.

      <p>
	 Providing a high level of adaptability, Shark's kernel will relay on
	 this component implementation for list of run-time users to assign
	 new activity to. If this component isn't present, kernel will apply
	 basic assignment rules: if there are no any mappings, the assignment
	 for the user that created the process will be made, otherwise, assignments
	 will be made base on the mapping information.
