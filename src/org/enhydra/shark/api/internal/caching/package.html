	 Cache component interface.
      </p>
      <p>
	 Providing a high level of adaptability, Shark's kernel will relay on
	 this component implementation for caching of runtime objects (currently the
	 processes and resources), so that execution can be performed much faster.
	 If this component isn't present, kernel will not perform any caching - it will
	 always ask for data from DB.
	 If shark is used from more then one VM on the same DB at the same time,
	 it must be configured not to use any implementation of this component.
