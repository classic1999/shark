	 Process locking component interface.
      </p>
      <p>
	 In order to prevent possible concurrent attempts at process
	 instance Shark has a synchronization mechanism. Since Shark should
	 be safely executed from multiple virtual machines, it is obvious
	 that Java's <tt>synchronized</tt> keyword won't suffice.
      </p>
      <p>
	 This component helps the kernel keep up with concurrent clients,
	 keeping the record of processes (actually their Id's), that already
	 have another client accessing it. If a process is locked,
	 implementation may wait a while (configuration parameter), holding
	 the kernel (client application) until process becomes available
	 again.
