	 Common Shark package.
      </p>
      <p>
	 Contains interfaces and exceptions used in both client-side and
	 internal interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
    Expirience has learned us that it's not that easy to build any
    usefull expression to be used in xxIterators. Since Shark supports
    BeanShell and JavaScript, making expressions starts to be even more
    complicated once you start to use string literals. Also, reading
    and debugging of such expression might turn into very tedious task.
    On the other side OMG (or at least the way we read it) explicitely
    says set_expression method takes String as parameter, and there's
    no escape.
      </p>
      <p>
    ExpressionBuilder and it's extending interfaces/classes serves the
    intention to ease this task, although there is another benefit -
    it allows us to prepare such expressions xxIterator can execute
    directly against database, thus improving the performance.
      </p>
      <p>
    The old style building (and setting) expressions for iterators diplayed
    in the code snippet bellow, quite efficiently hides the actual expression.
<pre class="programlisting">
   ExecutionAdministration eAdmin=Shark.getInstance().getAdminInterface().getExecutionAdministration();
   eAdmin.connect("user","secret","","");

   WfProcessMgrIterator pmi=eAdmin.et_iterator_processmgr();
   // - old style building expression
   query="packageId.equals(\"test\") &amp;&amp; enabled.booleanValue()";
   // - old style building expression
   pmi.set_query_expression(query);
   WfProcessMgr[] procs=pmi.get_next_n_sequence(0);
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
    Our intention is to expose the main properties through ExpressionBuilders,
    allowing the code to be easier to write, more importantly easier to read 
    and maintain.
<pre class="programlisting">
   ExecutionAdministration eAdmin=Shark.getInstance().getAdminInterface().getExecutionAdministration();
   eAdmin.connect("user","secret","","");

   WfProcessMgrIterator pmi=eAdmin.et_iterator_processmgr();
   // - new style building expression
   ProcessMgrIteratorExpressionBuilder eb = Shark.getInstance()
         .getExpressionBuilderManager()
         .getProcessMgrIteratorExpressionBuilder();
   eb.addPackageIdEquals("test")
     .and()
     .addIsEnabled()
     .setOrderByName(ExpressionBuilder.ORDER_DESCENDING);
   // - new style building expression
   pmi.set_query_expression(eb.toExpression());
   WfProcessMgr[] procs=pmi.get_next_n_sequence(0);
</pre>
   Additional benefit is that now Shark can internally optimize such queries
   to be performed on DB server, instead of reading everything into memory,
   than comparing each instance there. Therefore new feature appered -
   ordering capability.
